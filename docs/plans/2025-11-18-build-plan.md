## Phase 4: Connect X-Gantry to Y-Frame

### Task 4.1: Choose Gantry Height Position

**Time:** 5 minutes

**Decision Point:** Select high or low gantry position based on typical slab thickness.

**High Position (tubes bolt to bottom of T-plates):**

- Router has maximum reach downward
- More ground clearance

**Low Position (tubes hang from top of T-plates, 3" lower):**
- Use for thick slabs (4-5")
- Router is closer to workpiece
- Less ground clearance

**Recommendation:** Start with LOW position (easier to surface thick slabs, can reconfigure later if needed for thin slabs).

**Verification:** Decision made and noted. Plan to use LOW position.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Binding or Rough Motion on Rails

**Cause:** Misaligned rails, debris on rails, or insufficient lubrication

**Solution:**
1. Check rail alignment (rails must be parallel)
2. Clean rails with degreaser and lint-free cloth
3. Apply appropriate lubricant per SBR20 manufacturer specs
4. Verify slide blocks are not damaged

### Issue: Frame Not Level or Unstable

**Cause:** Uneven floor, leveling feet not adjusted, loose fasteners

**Solution:**
1. Verify all leveling feet contact floor
2. Adjust feet methodically to achieve level
3. Check all frame fasteners are tight
4. Verify floor is reasonably flat (may need shims for severe unevenness)

### Issue: Router Plate Flexes or Vibrates

**Cause:** Acrylic too thin, insufficient support, loose mounting

**Solution:**
1. Verify plate is 1/2" thickness
2. Check all Z-bracket connections are tight (don't over-tighten)
3. Ensure 4-point support from all Z-brackets
4. Consider upgrading to 3/4" plate if flexing persists

### Issue: Gantry Not Perpendicular to Frame

**Cause:** T-plate positioning, uneven tightening, frame not square

**Solution:**
1. Loosen T-plate bolts
2. Measure from frame ends to gantry corners (should be equal)
3. Adjust gantry position
4. Retighten T-plates evenly

### Issue: Can't Reach Slab Thickness Range

**Cause:** Wrong gantry height position selected

**Solution:**
1. For thick slabs (4-5"): Use LOW position (current setup)
2. For thin slabs (1-2"): Reconfigure to HIGH position
   - Loosen T-plate gantry bolts (use lockwashers, so no Loctite to deal with)
   - Bolt T-plates to BOTTOM rivnuts instead of TOP
   - Retighten with lockwashers
